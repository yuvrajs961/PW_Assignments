        "Types of Qualitative Data\n",
        "Nominal Data: This is the simplest form of qualitative data. It consists of categories with no intrinsic ordering. The categories are mutually exclusive and cannot be ranked.\n",

        "Example:\n",
        "Gender: Male, Female, Non-binary\n",
        "Colors: Red, Blue, Green\n",
        "Marital Status: Single, Married, Divorced\n",
        "Ordinal Data: This type of data represents categories with a meaningful order, but the distances between the categories are not defined or measurable.\n",

        "Example:\n",
        "Education Level: High School, Bachelor's, Master's, Doctorate\n",
        "Rating Scale: Poor, Fair, Good, Excellent\n",

        "2. Quantitative Data\n",
        "Quantitative data, also known as numerical data, is data that can be measured and expressed in numerical terms. It allows for mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n",
        "\n",
        "Types of Quantitative Data\n",
        "Interval Data: This type of data involves numerical values where the difference between two values is meaningful, but there is no true zero point. You can measure the intervals between values, but the absence of a true zero means ratios are not meaningful.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "Temperature (in Celsius or Fahrenheit): The difference between 10¬∞C and 20¬∞C is the same as the difference between 30¬∞C and 40¬∞C, but 0¬∞C does not represent the complete absence of temperature.\n",
        "IQ Scores: An IQ of 120 is 20 points higher than 100, but an IQ of 0 does not indicate a complete absence of intelligence.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Ratio Data: This is the most advanced type of quantitative data. It has all the properties of interval data, but it also has a true zero point, which allows for meaningful comparisons in terms of ratios (e.g., \"twice as much\").\n",

        "Example:\n",
        "Height: A height of 160 cm is twice as tall as 80 cm, and 0 cm represents the absence of height.\n",
