This is achievable through Python’s built-in functions like int (), float (), str (), dict (), tuple (), list ().  It allows the developer to explicitly change the data type of variables as needed for different tasks within a program.\n",
        "#It is really important when performing some operations that require specific data types. For e.g. when a developer wants to convert a string input into an integer or converting a floating-point number to an integer to be used when whole numbers are needed which enables mathematical operations. In the same way we if a developer wants to convert a data into different structures like changing a list to a tuple for immutability or a string to a list for easier manipulation.\n",

        "#Conditional Statements like if, “elif” which is a short form of “else if” are provided by Python and also to manage the flow of the program.  If statement checks the initial condition and elif allows additional conditions to be tested if the previous ones are false. If none of the conditions are met then only the else block will run.\n",
