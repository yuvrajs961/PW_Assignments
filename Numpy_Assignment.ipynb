        "# 1. Efficient Memory Usage\n",
        "# Fixed Data Types: NumPy arrays store data of a single type in a contiguous memory block, whereas Python lists are heterogeneous and store references to objects, leading to higher memory overhead.\n",

        "# Vectorized Operations: NumPy performs operations on entire arrays without requiring explicit loops, leveraging highly optimized C implementations under the hood.\n",
        "# Reduction in Overhead: Python’s interpreted nature makes loops slow for large-scale computations, whereas NumPy processes data in bulk, minimizing the overhead.\n",
        "# 3. Faster Computation\n",
        "# Low-level Optimization: NumPy leverages low-level libraries (like BLAS and LAPACK) written in C or Fortran, ensuring superior performance for mathematical and matrix operations.\n",
        "# Avoids Type Checking: Operations on lists involve repeated type checking, whereas NumPy's fixed data type eliminates this, speeding up computations.\n",
        "# 4. Advanced Broadcasting\n",
        "# Automatic Handling of Shapes: NumPy efficiently applies operations across arrays of different shapes using broadcasting, reducing the need for manual reshaping or iteration.\n",
